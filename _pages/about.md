## Research interests

The research agenda mainly including:
 - **Self-supervised learning in the Medical Domain:** How can we utilize the self-supervised learning algorithms - learning visual representation without labeling data- to apply effectively in medical datasets? 

## Previous research experience
For my undergraduate thesis (2022), I worked on the problem of *Fall Detection*. The thesis is on the topic of *Computer Vision* as well as *Medical domain*, which interested me because I wanted to utilize the application of Computer Vision to avoid some serious injuries caused by falls in our community.

From 8/2022 to 4/2023, I was a Research Intern at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence ([DFKI](https://www.dfki.de/web)). I worked on utilizing *Self-supervised learning* for Medical data. You can find out more in my [CV](https://hoangnguyen210.github.io//cv/).
